# Preparation

## Codespaces

In this tutorial, we will be using GitHub Codespaces to run the exercises.
If you are not familiar with Codespaces, please refer to the
[Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) for more information.

1. Navigate to the
   [FTorch-workshop repo page](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch-workshop)
   repository and click on the green "Code" button.
   **NOTE**: Make sure you open a Codespace for `FTorch-workshop`, not `FTorch`.
2. Select "Codespaces" and then "Create codespace on main".
3. Wait for the codespace to be created and opened in your browser. You will be put in a
   VSCode environment with a terminal at the bottom.

Note that we have set up the codespace to have a Python virtual environment set up and
activated for you.

:::{.fragment}
Execute the following to start the FTorch build process **using source**:
```default
source build_FTorch.sh
```
**NOTE**: It's insufficient to just run `./build_FTorch.sh` because this will not export the
required environment variables to the current shell session.
