# Applications and Case Studies


## MiMA - proof of concept

- The origins of FTorch
  - Emulation of existing parameterisation
  - Coupled to an atmospheric model using `forpy` in @espinosa2022machine^[Originally written in TensorFlow...]
  - Prohibitively slow and hard to implement
  - Asked for a faster, user-friendly implementation that can be used in future studies.

\

- Follow up paper using FTorch: *Uncertainty Quantification of a Machine Learning Subgrid-Scale Parameterization for Atmospheric Gravity Waves* [@mansfield2024uncertainty]
  - "Identical" offline networks have very different behaviours when deployed online.

## ICON

- Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model
  - Developed by DKRZ (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum)
  - Used by the DWD and Meteo-Swiss

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=75%}
- *Interpretable multiscale Machine Learning-Based Parameterizations of Convection for ICON* [@heuer2023interpretable]^[Work without direct involvement of ICCS - success on 'ease of use' of FTorch]
  - Train U-Net convection scheme on high-res simulation
  - Deploy in ICON via FTorch coupling
  - Evaluate physical realism (causality) using SHAP values
  - Online stability improved when non-causal relations are eliminated from the net

## CESM - Bias Correction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
 Work by Will Chapman of NCAR/M2LInES

- As representations of physics models have inherent, sometimes systematic, biases.

- Run CESM for 9 years relaxing hourly to ERA5 observation (data assimilation)
- Train CNN to predict anomaly increment at each level
  - targeting just the MJO region
  - targeting globally
- Apply online as part of predictive runs

## CESM coupling

- The Community Earth System Model
- Part of [CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project)
- Make it easy for users
  - FTorch integrated into the build system (CIME)
    - [{{< fa brands github >}}/Cambridge-ICCS/cime_je](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/cime_je)
  - `libtorch` is included on the software stack on Derecho
    - Improves reproducibility
